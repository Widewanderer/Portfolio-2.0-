        Welcome! My name is Slava and I am a full stack web developer. I have
        experience with JavaScript,CSS, HTML, React, Git, MongoDB, ORM, MVC,
        PWAs, MySQL, Node.js, and more. I have worked on team projects, have a
        orginization centered outlook, and good communication skills.

        I was first introduced to programming by my brother and my friend who
        would speak to me about their work and basic computer science topics.
        However, I only really began exploring the world of programming myself
        in 2021. At first I just learned some simple concepts, began to learn a
        little JavaScript and watching some videos. In the fall of 2022 I worked
        through Codecademy's Learn JavaScript course. It was then I decided to
        pursue programming more seriously and decided to enroll in a Fullstack
        JavaScript Bootcamp though Vanderbuilt University in Nashville, TN. I am
        currently working my way though the University of Vanderbuilt's Full
        Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I am also learning suplementary STEM
        skills using the Brilliant app and doing additional coding practice
        using the Codeacedmy website. ( What I am doing now// What I want to do
